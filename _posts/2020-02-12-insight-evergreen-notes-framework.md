Constraint relaxation and chunk decomposition as means to insights. What about a note-taking workflow that facilitates these two processes ? Because loose chunks are more likely to be decomposed than tight chunks, an idea is to target systematically notes that are not densely linked because they correspond to tight chunks. For constraint relaxation, the workflow should focus on making current assumptions explicit. The higlighting step from progressive summarization can be used to identify hidden assumptions. The results of trying to come up with this workflow may be an interesting writing project that can be used to build up reputation in the note-taking world.

Note-taking facilitates writing because it enables manipulating an abstract entity by manipulating a concrete entity.
An idea is represented as a distribution of activation of pieces of knowledge in memory. A note is an externalized representation of the idea that it captures. This is arguably where the strength of note-taking comes from: by manipulating a note, which is a concrete entity, we can manipulate an idea, which is an abstract entity . Thinking is difficult, it means being able to divide your mind into people and withstanding the tension of them battling it out. Because our brain is more powerful a processor than a storage, and it's the playing out of the dialogue that contains the potential for novel ideas, we should externalize as much as what's necessary for the internal conversation to take place. In other words, we think more effectively by manipulating our notes.

## Densely linked evergreen notes facilitate insights by facilitating chunk decomposition.

Chunk decomposition is one way to reach insights. A chunk is a compact representation of an idea, which is very similar to a note. In fact, if we replace chunk with note, then an evergreen note is equivalent to a chunk. Chunk decomposition then becomes note decomposition. A loose chunk consists of other meaningful chunks, so a densely linked note is a loose chunk because it is made up of other notes . We also know that loose chunks are much more likely to be decomposed before tight chunks. Therefore, densely linked evergreen notes facilitate insights by facilitating chunk decomposition.

## A technique to generate insights with evergreen notes using chunk decomposition.

Because evergreen notes are atomic and concept-oriented, we usually load such a note into memory as an atomic chunk that focuses on a concept, for example by recalling the title, or the highlighted sentences. When think about a situation, we represent the problem/solution space by a set of chunks. Each chunk is then externalized by an evergreen note.
If our initial representation is inadequate, then we can go through each evergreen note that makes up the representation and decompose it into the component evergreen notes. The relationship between each component evergreen note and the rest of the evergreen notes that make up the initial representation forms another representation of the situation. If this representation again is inadequate, then we can recursively apply this decomposition technique to all remaining evergreen notes.

Each situation whose solution requires insights is likely to be unique, but this technique is theoretically guaranteed to produce an insight, if there is one available with our current repertoire of evergreen notes.
