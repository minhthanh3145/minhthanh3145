Hi there, I am Thanh, a software engineer.

I like to create values through software development and business collaboration.

I converse mainly in Java. My experience includes:
- OSGi for modularized desktop application development.
- Web Extension architecture.
- Relational database: PostgreSQL.
- Non-relational database: NoSQL.
- Front-end development: React, Hyperapp.
- Server-side development: Spring Boot, NodeJS.
- Data Visualization: d3JS.

Overall, I have more extensive experience with back-end development, relative to front-end development.

My professional experience and interests, besides software development, span across the spectrum of product development. I have:
- Created and delivered values to users by proposing and defending product requirements.
- Helped Enterprises adopt our tools formally through leading technical training courses.
- Identified Product-Market fit by conducting Cohort Analysis.

Also, I maintain side-projects, which are broadly categorized as followed:
- [Dafuq is that Blog](https://dafuqisthatblog.wordpress.com/)
- [Another Writing Application](https://another-writing-application.netlify.app/)
